# AI Agents Documentation

This project leverages various AI agents and tools to assist in different stages of development. This document defines the roles, responsibilities, and interaction protocols for the AI agents involved in developing the L'Archipel Libre website. It should serve as a comprehensive record of:

- Which AI agents were used
- What tasks they performed
- How they contributed to the project
- Lessons learned from AI collaboration

## Project Overview
- **Project:** L'Archipel Libre Website
- **Mission:** "Des √Ælots de technologie au service du lien social."
- **Human Agents:** Two-Developer Team
- **AI Agents:** 
   - **Gemini (Conception AI):** Used for initial project conceptualisation.
   - **Copilot CLI (Development AI):** The primary AI partner for code generation, architecture, and implementation, powered by the Claude model.

## ü§ñ AI Agents 

### Gemini (Conception AI)

**Primary Role:** Strategic Partner & Conceptual Facilitator.

**Mandate:** To assist the human team in defining the project's identity, goals, ethical foundations, and initial strategic documents.

**Status:** This agent's primary role is complete for the project conception phase.

---

### Copilot CLI (Development AI)

**Primary Role:** AI Pair Programmer & Technical Architect.

**Mandate:** To actively assist the two-developer team in the 10-day "Vibe Code" sprint by accelerating development, providing best-practice solutions, and ensuring code quality. 

**Key Responsibilities:**
   - **Code Generation:** Full-stack code generation, refactoring, and test generation. Generate initial project structure, boilerplate code for entities (User, Event, ForumThread, etc.), controllers, services, and repositories. 
   - **Architecture & Security:** Provide best-practice examples and configurations for Spring Security, JWT implementation, and secure password storage (BCrypt).
   - **Frontend Development:** Assist in generating Angular 17 components, NgRx state logic, and Angular Material implementations.
   - **Testing & Quality Assurance:** Unit test generation, test scenario design and suggest test cases for edge cases and security.
   - **Documentation:** Assist in generating README, CONTRIBUTING guide, API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI), architecture docs and inline code comments. 
   - **Deployment & Operations:** Docker configuration, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline setup, deployment scripts

## Guiding Principles (Rules for All Agents)

All code, whether written by humans or generated by the AI, **must** adhere to these principles:
- **Security-First:** Proactively address secure password storage (BCrypt), prevent common web vulnerabilities, and implement scalable JWT-based authentication. 
- **Clean & Readable Code:** Code must be maintainable, well-commented, and follow SOLID principles.
- **MVP Focus:** All development must prioritize the 10-day MVP timeline. Focus is on core functionality (Auth, Events, Forum).
- **FOSS Alignment:** The project's technology stack (Java, Angular, Postgres) and ethos must align with the core project value of "Souverainet√© Num√©rique" (Digital Sovereignty) through FOSS.
- **Responsive Design:** The frontend must be responsive and follow a mobile-first approach.

## Documentation & Interaction Protocol

To maintain transparency and a clear development history, all agents (human and AI) will follow this protocol:
- **Prompt Logging:** All significant prompts given to the Copilot CLI for architecture, complex logic, or configuration must be recorded in the `docs/prompts.md` file. 
- **Bilingual Documentation:** All user-facing documentation in markdown files (e.g., `README.md`) must have the English version first, immediately followed by the French translation. Use clickable British and French flag emojis to allow users to click to easily navigate to the language section they prefer. 
- **API Documentation:** The backend API will be documented using Swagger/OpenAPI.
- **Human Review:** No AI-generated code is committed to the `main` or `develop` branch without explicit review and approval by a human developer. This is the most critical rule to ensure code quality and security.
