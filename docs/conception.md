## üí° Design Decisions Log

### Decision Log Template

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Decision:** Brief title  
**Context:** What problem are we solving?  
**Options Considered:**
1. Option A: Pros/Cons
2. Option B: Pros/Cons
3. Option C: Pros/Cons

**Decision Made:** Chosen option and why  
**Consequences:** Expected impact and trade-offs  
**AI Contribution:** How AI assisted in this decision

### Decision #001: Documentation Structure

**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Decision:** Establish comprehensive documentation framework

**Context:** Need to track all AI usage and development decisions from the start.

**Options Considered:**
1. Minimal documentation: Quick but lacks detail
2. Comprehensive documentation: Time-intensive but thorough
3. Hybrid approach: Balance between the two

**Decision Made:** Comprehensive documentation approach

**Rationale:**
- Educational project requires detailed tracking
- AI usage needs thorough documentation
- Provides learning material for future projects

**Consequences:**
- More upfront time investment
- Better long-term project understanding
- Easier collaboration and handoff

**AI Contribution:** AI agent generated initial documentation templates and structure.
