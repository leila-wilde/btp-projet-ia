# BTP Projet IA - Virtual Start-up

A virtual start-up project developed entirely using generative AI, created by [Leila Wilde](https://github.com/leila-wilde) and [Louis Cordier](https://github.com/louis-cordier).

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a virtual start-up using generative AI throughout all stages, from initial planning and design to implementation and documentation.

## 📋 Project Goals

- Build a functional virtual start-up solution
- Document AI usage at every stage of development
- Showcase best practices for AI-assisted software development
- Create a replicable template for AI-driven projects
